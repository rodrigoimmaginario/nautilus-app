rem Builds the Windows x64 whisper.cpp command-line component the voice manifest names, as one
rem statically linked executable: no DLLs beside it, the C runtime linked in, so the single-file
rem manifest entry holds. Run from a Developer Command Prompt or any shell: it finds the Visual
rem Studio 2022 Build Tools, their CMake and Ninja, on its own.
rem
rem   scripts\build_whisper_cli_windows.cmd [version]      default: v1.8.3 (the manifest's componentVersion)
rem
rem Output: build\whisper-cli-<version>-windows-x64.exe and its sha256, ready for the manifest:
rem   {"platform":"windows","architecture":"x64","fileName":"whisper-cli-<version>-windows-x64.exe",
rem    "url":"https://updates.mirrormind.sh/mirror-desktop/voice/<fileName>","sha256":"…","sizeBytes":…}
rem
rem Flags: AVX2 on, native tuning off (the binary runs on any x64 machine of the last decade),
rem OpenMP off (no vcomp DLL), SDL off (the stream examples are not built), tests off.
rem whisper.cpp declares CMake 3.5, so policy CMP0091 is old there and CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY is
rem ignored without a word: the binary then needs VCRUNTIME140.dll and MSVCP140.dll. The policy is
rem set new so the C runtime is really linked in (CR240; the CI job checks the imports).
